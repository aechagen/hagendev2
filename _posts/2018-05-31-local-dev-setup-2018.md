title: My Local Development Setup 2018

Decided that my first post should be a setup post, both to show off my sweet setup and to use as a reference point for myself in the future.. Kind of a "started from the bottom now I'm here"? 

### The Hardware
- Microsoft Surface Pro 2017
	- Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB
- HP 23 inch monitor

### The Software
- Visual Studio Code
- Local for WordPress
- ~~Prepros~~ Use Visual Studio built in live server/SCSS compiler now

So I guess there's not a lot to it. I moved from a 2016 Macbook Pro back in August last year, and so far have not looked back! I like that the Surface can be used as both a tablet and a regular laptop with the keyboard that acts as a cover for the screen. When I'm at home, I connect the Surface to my monitor for some dual monitor action. 

Running Linux on Windows was kind of skeptical at first, coming from Mac, but after some trial and error periods, everything works the way that I expect! A majority of the time, I just use Visual Studio Code to interact with the Linux side of the house and it works great somehow.
