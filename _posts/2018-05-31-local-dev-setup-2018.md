title: My Local Development Setup 2018

Decided that my first post should be a setup post, both to show off my sweet setup and to use as a reference point for myself in the future.. Kind of a "started from the bottom now I'm here"? 

### The Hardware
- Microsoft Surface Pro 2017
	- Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB
- HP 23 inch monitor

### The Software
- Visual Studio Code
- Local for WordPress
- ~~Prepros~~ Use Visual Studio built in live server/SCSS compiler now

So I guess there's not a lot to it. I moved from a 2016 Macbook Pro back in August last year, and so far have not looked back! I like that the Surface can be used as both a tablet and a regular laptop with the keyboard that acts as a cover for the screen. When I'm at home, I connect the Surface to my monitor for some dual monitor action.

I was kind of skeptical running Linux on Windows at first coming from Mac/built-in Unix, but after some trial and error periods, everything works the way that I expect! A majority of the time, I just use Visual Studio Code to interact with the Linux side of the house and it works great somehow.
