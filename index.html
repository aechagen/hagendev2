        Hello! I'm a wannabe front end developer. My actual job is as a Hospital Corpsman in the
        <span class="navy"><a href="https://www.navy.com/">US Navy</a></span>, currently stationed in Yokosuka, Japan with my wife and three boys. We're having a blast here!

        I've been teaching myself the ways of the web on and off since 2015, which is pretty crazy
        to me, especially since I'm still learning new things seemingly every day. Over the years,
        my style hasn't changed much either.. I rely on logical layouts, fancy fonts and captivating colors to get my point across. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not doing cool stuff on the internets, I'm spending time with my amazing family,
        playing <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/aechagen"> chess</a>, reading, video gaming on my Switch, Pokemon battling with co-workers and watching The Office (again).

          I blog about things that I like. Most of the time, it's about cool things I learn about the web.
          Other times, it'll be about my life and stuff. You should <a href="/blog.html">check it out!</a>

         Completely off topic (or is it?), but I'm also a lover of EDC (Every Day Carry) and cool tech stuff. I made a list of some pretty cool things that I like. <a href="http://a.co/hH2PxwC">Take a look!</a>
